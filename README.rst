Scripts to simplify transcoding MKV files into mp4 files.

Currently, the scripts are set up assuming that the output should be for
a Chromecast device, but that should be easily fixed.

TODOs:

* Support for TV Shows
* Support for multi-disc movies
* Provide a way to change transcode parameters (e.g., set output resolution)
