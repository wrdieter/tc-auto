Scripts to simplify transcoding MKV files into mp4 files.

Currently, the scripts are set up assuming that the output should be for
a Chromecast device, but that should be easily fixed.

TODOs:

* Support for TV Shows
* Support for multi-disc movies
* Provide a way to change transcode parameters (e.g., set output resolution)
* Surely, there must be a way to get the titles from the DVD menu

  Long term, it would be nice to have a database mapping makemkv titles
  to content names and categories (Behind the Scenes, Trailer, etc.) if
  there is not a way to read it from the disc directly.
