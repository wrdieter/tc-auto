TODO Notes:

* Surely, there must be a way to get the titles from the DVD menu

  Long term, it would be nice to have a database mapping makemkv titles
  to content names and categories (Behind the Scenes, Trailer, etc.) if
  there is not a way to read it from the disc directly.

* Need a license and license file
